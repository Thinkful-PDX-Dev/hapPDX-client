	review: 'Great happy hour, fun decor, hip crowd. This place used to be a locksmith, hence the name. The bar has keys under a later if resignation as a reminder of the theme. Nice booths for medium sized groups a large patio for larger groups, though some book club had it booked tonight... Decent burger, I appreciate the pemento cheese, I think fried chicken sandwich might be the way to go.',
